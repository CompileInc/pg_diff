pg diff
=======
A simple tool to diff serveral properties of schemas in two postgresql databases.

Now supported diff options are:

* table_name 
* table_count
* table_schema
* row_count
* table_size 
* index_size
* `table_total_size`

# Why

Recently I worked on database migration things, and very need a tool to analyze the consistency between source and target database. So I make this tool to some simple comparison, and it looks good to me:)

# Prerequisite

You need to install `postgresql` firstly, because `pg_diff` will use `psycopg2` to execute some commands.

# Installation

`pip install pg_diff`

# Usage

`pg_diff --type=table_count 'host=source dbname=test user=postgres password=secret port=5432' 'host=target dbname=test user=postgres password=secret port=5432' --verbose`

```
Usage:
  pg_diff --type=T_NAME SOURCE_DSN TARGET_DSN [--verbose]
  pg_diff -h | --help
  pg_diff --version

Arguments:
  SOURCE_DSN     dsn for source database, like "host=xxx dbname=test user=postgres password=secret port=5432"
  TARGET_DSN     dsn for target database, like "host=xxx dbname=test user=postgres password=secret port=5432"

Options:
  --type=T_NAME  Type name to compare in category, valid input likes: table_name, table_count, table_schema, row_count, table size. index size, table_total_size
  -h --help      Show help info.
  --verbose      Show verbose information.
  --version      Show version.
```

# Implementation

Mainly using libraries below to make this tool:

* docopt==0.6.2
* schema==0.6.5
* deepdiff==2.5.1
* psycopg2==2.6.2

And I use some SQL to query the status of schema, like table size, index size and etc.

# Contribution
1. Fork the repository on GitHub.
2. Make a branch off of master and commit your changes to it.
3. Run the tests with `tox`
  * Either use `tox` to build against all supported Python versions (if you have them installed) or use `tox -e py{version}` to test against a specific version, e.g., `tox -e py27` or `tox -e py33`.
4. Submit a Pull Request to the master branch on GitHub.

If you'd like to have a development environment for `pg_diff`, you should create a virtualenv and then do `pip install -e .` from within the directory.
